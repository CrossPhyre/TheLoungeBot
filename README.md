# TheLoungeBot
This Discord bot is built in Python and contains custom functionality. Currently, this functionality includes functionality to playback audio from YouTube videos and functionality to manage tasks.

This implementation depends on an ffmpeg executable. This file is too large to include directly in the repository, so this executable must be included at the .\shared\dependencies\ffmpeg\ directory.
